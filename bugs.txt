List of Bugs:
    1. isEmpty always returns true
        - isEmpty returns true for a non empty list after addFront
        - isEmpty returns true for a non empty list after addBack
        - addFront and addBack are working because the tests for size and search after addFront and addBack passed

	2. addBack places the node at the front of the list.
        - addBack works when the list is empty, because the back node is the front node
        - addBack doesn't work when the list is non empty, because it adds the node to the front of the list

	3. removeBack doesn't remove the back node
        - It assumes the list is empty, when it is not, and returns false because it doesn't remove a node
        - size stays the same

    4. removeBack doesn't remove the back node
        - It assumes the list is empty, when it is not, and returns false because it doesn't remove a node
        - size stays the same
